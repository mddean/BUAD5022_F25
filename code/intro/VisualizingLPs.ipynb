    "# Geometric Interpretation of Linear Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to examine small instances of linear programs (LPs) visually to help understand the geometry of what is involved in the formulation and solving of an LP. We will start by looking at two-variable problems because they are easy to draw. In particular, we will use the Python package `gilp` ([Geometric Interpretation of Linear Programs](https://gilp.henryrobbins.com/en/latest/index.html)). Under the hood, `gilp` uses the package [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/) to make the graphics interactive.\n",

    "## Formulation Example 1 From Lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "You work for a clothing manufacturer as the shop floor supervisor. One of your responsibilities it to help determine the weekly production quantities for the two products produced in your factory: men’s shirts and men’s pajamas. There are two major steps to making both of these products: (1) cutting the material and (2) sewing the material. Over the next week you have 280 hours available in the sewing department and 450 hours available in the cutting department. Each shirt takes 1 hour of sewing and 90 minutes of cutting. Each pair of PJs takes 45 minutes of sewing and 2 hours of cutting. You estimate that each shirt produced will add \\\\$4 in profit and each pair of PJs will add \\\\$3 in profit. Formulate the LP.\r\n"
